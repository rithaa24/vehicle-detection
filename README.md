Introduction
This project focuses on detecting vehicles in images and videos using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles, in various environments and conditions.

Features
Vehicle detection in static images.
Real-time vehicle detection in video streams.
Support for multiple vehicle types.
Pre-trained models available for quick deployment.
Customizable model training for specific datasets.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-detection.git
cd vehicle-detection
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Detect Vehicles in Images
Place your images in the images/ directory.
Run the detection script:
bash
Copy code
python detect_images.py --input_dir images/ --output_dir output/
Detect Vehicles in Videos
Place your videos in the videos/ directory.
Run the detection script:
bash
Copy code
python detect_videos.py --input_dir videos/ --output_dir output/
Dataset
The project uses the COCO dataset for training and evaluation. You can download the dataset from the official website and place it in the data/ directory.

Model Training
To train the model on a custom dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in the data/ directory.
Configure the training parameters in config.yaml.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --config config.yaml
Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, run:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_path models/your_model.h5 --data_path data/
Results
The results of the vehicle detection can be found in the output/ directory. Each image and video will have bounding boxes drawn around detected vehicles along with confidence scores.
